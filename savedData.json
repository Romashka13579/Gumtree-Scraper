As an industry leader, we offer an unparalleled range of standard profiles in various dimensions as well as fully customized coving designs tailored to your project needs.\n\nWhether you are a homeowner, builder, interior designer, or commercial contractor, Homemerce has a coving solution to suit your requirements. Our premium coatings come in a variety of timeless patterns that will instantly elevate and enhance any room. Choose from classic to contemporary profiles with details ranging from subtle curves to bold scrollwork.\n\nAll Homemerce covings are manufactured from durable yet lightweight polystyrene, coated in multiple layers of protective plaster for a flawlessly smooth finish. This results in an ultra-realistic look at a fraction of the cost and effort of traditional plaster mouldings. Our advanced production process ensures each piece exhibits crisp detail, consistent sizing, and a perfectly uniform coat.\n\nFor residential spaces, Homemerce covings provide a custom decorative touch at an affordable price point. You'll enjoy the beauty and longevity of plaster at a lower cost and with minimal mess during installation compared to full plaster work. For commercial interiors, our wide range of profiles allows you to make a distinctive design statement while controlling expenses.\n\nIn addition to our standard coving range, Homemerce is pleased to create fully customized designs based on your provided specifications. Send us a drawing or photo of your desired shape, detail and dimensions and we will provide a quote and timeline to bring your vision to life. All work is done to impeccable standards so the end result looks handcrafted rather than mass produced.\n\nWhether for business or home, people come to Homemerce covings for our unrivaled quality, customer service and the ability to fulfill both small and large scale coving needs.\n\nContact us today for coving quotes, samples, advice or to discuss a custom design project.

Leave to ferment in a wort of cheerful derangement until the barrel bursts. Bingo! Tales of Landos! Sure, Whyatt is derivative, but where he parts company from so many others trying to marry fantasy, humour, and social satire in the wake of the much-missed Pterry is that his work is infused with the same kind of energy and spark as the original - and is already starting to go its own way. Landos and its surroundings are perhaps not yet as cohesive and realised as Ankh-Morpork, but they're getting there, and I'm enjoying the process.\" - Bobelix (Amazon UK)\n\nReviewed in the United States on 24 June 2022\nVerified Purchase\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f \"Svelt is a humorous fantasy novel. It is a leisurely, comedic and character-driven take on fantasy which the author himself describes as \u201cun-epic.\u201d The book is in the same vein of fantasy as Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld series, perhaps with a dash of Piers Anthony\u2019s punny Xanth series dropped in. Like Discworld\u2019s Ankh-Morpork, the city of Landos becomes a fascinating character in its own right.\n\nSvelt is a well-thought-out, good-hearted hero with whom the reader will take instant sympathy. You are taken through a great adventure, exploring the city of Landos and its menagerie of funny, frightening and mysterious characters. You will genuinely feel for Svelt when the story ends.\" - Mark Cromwell (Amazon)\n\nI've also just released my humorous football book 'A Step Too VAR'.\n\nI'd like to keep them in the highest position possible, so even if you read some pages on Kindle Unlimited it all counts.

A professional and qualified luthier and guitar repairman and welcome to Kozzis Guitar Workshop.\n\nI offer the finest guitar and bass setup and repair service in Northern Ireland\n\nTo back this up and put your mind at ease that when your guitar comes to me us the in the best possible hands -\n\nJust take a look the hundreds of named customer feedback and reviews on my Facebook page. They are beyond positive with many people returning again and again with their entire guitar collection for setup. You can't get a better setup nor better service than what I offer.\n\nNo other guitar luthier or technician has such postive reviews of their work like I do. Reviews in the hundreds with customers returning again and again.\n\nThis isn't a hobby. This is what I do. When your guitar comes to me it gets setup PROPERLY and right first time\n\nAdd me on FB\nKozzi's GuitarWorkshop\n\nAgain, all my feedback and craft is documented on there. All clearly documented examples of how your guitar can be transformed completely.\n\nI can sort it professionally for you and resolve the issues rather than hide them like some do.\n\nDon't struggle on a poorly setup instrument. All guitars after a good setup and some proper TLC play and sound the very best\n\nAs for me.....\nExperienced guitarist playing 40 years and setting up guitars for decades and professionally learnt the setup and build process by the very best there was.\n\nMy turnaround is quick and my craft is top notch and I'm open and honest\n\nI make the setup process a very personal experience for you explaining the whole process from start to end so you can see the care and results I take with your instrument.\n\nThe instrument is setup to how YOU want it to play not how it should be as many luthiers ignore the way the YOU wants it to play. They follow set measurements only and this isn't ideal when it comes to feeling a big difference when you get your instrument back.\n\nAnything I setup you can see and feel the difference after I set it up.\nThe setup is tailored to how you the player wants it to play.\n\nI setup guitars both electric and acoustic as well as bass guitars in a professional, knowledgeable and timely manner. I also setup mandolin and banjo.\n\nI keep a huge amount of spares onsite and nothing leaves me without being absolutely perfect.\n\nAnd the coffee pots always on\n\nRyan", "link": "https://www.gumtree.com/p/guitar-instrument/guitar-setup-repair-luthier-services-belfast-ni-guitar-repair-setup-/1472972946"}, "128": {"name": "Office furniture for sale", "price": "\u00a31.00", "description": "1 x Boardroom table \u00a3100\n10 x white chairs \u00a320 per chair\n13 x office tables with pedi stole \u00a350 per unit\n9 x Cabinets with sliding doors \u00a340 per unit\n6 x Grey chairs \u00a310 per unit\n14 x Blue chairs \u00a315 per unit\n1 x Large shelfing unit \u00a350\n\nOAK WOOD FURNITURE\n\n1 x corner table \u00a3100\n1 x oak wood cabinet \u00a3125\n1 x oak wood shelf unit \u00a350\n\nOr \u00a3250 for oak wood package\n\n\nAll furniture in good condition\n\nCollection only.", "link": "https://www.gumtree.com/p/other-office-furniture/office-furniture-for-sale-/1482483882"}, "129": {"name": "Low level wall cabinet in three sections", "price": "\u00a30.00", "description": "Low level wall wooden cabinet in three sections - main centre piece plus two cutaway end sections.
